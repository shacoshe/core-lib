# 
it happened to me as a sole developer, when I had to upgrade the web framework. while the next release of it was entirely different.
the stack of choice got outdated to run on the new server configuration (security issues.) and I had all my logic as part of the framework classes.
at the time I had two option to migrate manually/some automatic tool (that hopefully would like my style of coding/plugins/etc.) or just to drop it.
so we got separated by progress.
the relationship of my code with the framework was tight. and I can only wish it was nothing more then a library i could move to a totally different framework that acts only as mask to my application apiâ€™s.
